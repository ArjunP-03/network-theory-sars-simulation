# Network Theory and SARS Simulation

This project reproduces and analyzes results from Meyers et al.'s study on the SARS outbreak using network theory and epidemiological modeling. It was completed as part of **CSCI 3352 â€“ Biological Networks** at the University of Colorado Boulder (Fall 2024).

## Project Overview
- Modeled disease spread across various network structures, including random, small-world, and scale-free networks.
- Simulated outbreak dynamics to understand how network topology affects transmission.
- Reproduced key findings from Meyers et al.'s "Network Theory and SARS" study.
- Analyzed results to gain data-driven insights into epidemic propagation.

## Goals
- Apply network theory to model epidemic spread.
- Demonstrate how different network topologies impact the speed and scale of outbreaks.
- Gain hands-on experience with epidemiological modeling in Python.

## Methodology
- Simulations were performed to model disease transmission across different types of networks.
- Key metrics such as infection rate, peak infection, and outbreak duration were analyzed.
- Python libraries used included `NetworkX`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib` for modeling and visualization.

## Results & Insights
- Different network structures showed distinct patterns in outbreak dynamics.
- Small-world networks tended to spread infection faster than random networks.
- Analysis confirmed key trends reported in the original Meyers et al. study.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NetworkX (graph modeling)
- NumPy / Pandas (data handling)
- Matplotlib (visualizations)

## Project Artifacts
- **Report / Presentation:** [Final Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fumZyrQmjkjLv4bC6rfejxYPUGgOdw8r-ByYGD3JnsQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Original code:** Not available; future versions may include recreated simulations.

## Future Work
- Recreate the simulations in Python to provide code and interactive notebooks.
- Extend the project to analyze other epidemiological datasets.
- Implement more complex network structures and disease models.
